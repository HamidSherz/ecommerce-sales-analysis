![](Intro_Image.png) 

## Introduction
Welcome to the E-Commerce Data Analysis project! This project provides an in-depth analysis of e-commerce transaction data, focusing on understanding customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends to drive strategic business decisions.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this analysis was to uncover actionable insights from e-commerce transaction data to:
- Identify top-selling products and revenue drivers
- Analyze customer spending variations across categories
- Detect seasonal trends and patterns of behavior
- Understand high-value customers and their purchasing behaviors
- Assess sales performance across different geographical regions

## Applied Techniques
This project applied techniques in:
- Descriptive Analysis üìä
- Segmentation Analysis üîç
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìà
- Predictive Analysis üîÆ
- Business Intelligence (BI) Techniques üìâ
- Data Visualization üìâ
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) üîÑ
- Data Transformation üîß
- Data Modeling üìê
- Calculated Fields üî¢

## Data Sourcing
The data for this analysis was acquired from a comprehensive e-commerce dataset, which includes:
- Sales records
- Customer information
- Product details
- Regional sales data

This dataset provides an extensive view of transaction dynamics and customer behavior.

## Data Transformation
The data was processed to ensure accuracy and consistency through the following steps:
- **Data Validation**: Identified and aggregated duplicate entries by summing the `Quantity` and averaging the `UnitPrice`, then consolidated this data into a new table (`transactions3_temp`) to ensure each transaction was uniquely represented.
- **Data Selection**: Selected relevant columns from the original dataset to focus on key variables for analysis.
- **Data Standardization**: Standardized data formats to ensure consistency across the dataset.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated data by product categories and regions to facilitate detailed analysis.
- **Calculated Fields**: Created calculated fields in Tableau to enhance analysis, including metrics such as total revenue and customer segmentation.

## Modelling
Key models and techniques were applied to analyze and predict performance:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Applied segmentation analysis to categorize customers into Low, Medium, and High Value segments based on purchasing behavior and other metrics.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Used predictive analysis techniques to forecast future sales trends based on historical data.
- **Data Modeling**: Developed models to understand relationships and performance metrics, including KPIs and calculated fields.

## Analysis & Visualization
Key analyses performed using Tableau and SQL:

- **Sales Trends**:
  - **Monthly Peaks**: Sales peaked at ¬£1,450,000 in Nov/Dec with a 163.64% growth from Jan to Nov.
  - **Seasonal Surge**: Notable Q4 increase due to holiday shopping; stable sales from May to Aug.

- **Top Products**:
  - **Highest Sales**: Regency Cakestand (¬£164,000); majority of top products priced between ¬£1-¬£3.

- **Customer Segmentation**:
  - **Behavior**: High-value customers peak in Nov/Dec, particularly from the UK and Germany; steady purchases from the Netherlands and Ireland.
  - **Regional Revenue**: UK leads in revenue, followed by Germany, Netherlands, and Ireland.

- **KPIs**:
  - **Retention Rate**: Stable at 87-92% monthly, 65% overall.
  - **CLV**: Increased to ¬£860.37 in Dec.
  
### Key Findings

| Metric                      | Value                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Top-Selling Product**     | Regency Cakestand (¬£164,000) |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | ¬£52.30                |
| **Retention Rate**          | 87-92% Monthly        |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | ¬£860.37           |

## Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:
- **Sales Trends**: Nov/Dec saw significant peaks and stable sales from May to August.
- **Top Products**: Regency Cakestand and similarly priced items drove high sales.
- **Customer Behavior**: High-value customers peak in Nov/Dec with strong contributions from the UK and Germany.
- **KPIs**: Retention rates and CLV are stable and increasing, respectively.

**Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Optimize Inventory for Peaks**: Adjust inventory levels to align with high sales periods in Nov/Dec.
2. **Refine Marketing Tactics**: Focus marketing efforts on underperforming months and regions.
3. **Enhance Customer Engagement**: Develop targeted strategies for high-value customers during peak periods.

**Areas for Further Investigation**
1. **Seasonal Correlations**: Investigate the factors driving seasonal sales peaks.
2. **Product Profitability**: Analyze profitability trends for products with unique sales patterns.
3. **AOV Variations**: Investigate variations in Average Order Value (AOV) among high-value customers across different regions to optimize pricing and promotional strategies.
