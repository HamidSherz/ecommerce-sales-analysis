## Introduction
Welcome to the E-Commerce Data Analysis project! This project provides an in-depth analysis of e-commerce transaction data, focusing on understanding customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends to drive strategic business decisions.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this analysis was to uncover actionable insights from e-commerce transaction data to:
- Identify top-selling products and revenue drivers
- Analyze customer spending variations across categories
- Detect seasonal trends and patterns of behavior
- Understand high-value customers and their purchasing behaviors
- Assess sales performance across different geographical regions

## Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I demonstrated proficiency in:
- Descriptive Analysis 📊
- Segmentation Analysis 🔍
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈
- Predictive Analysis 🔮
- Business Intelligence (BI) Techniques 📉
- Data Visualization 📉
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) 🔄
- Data Transformation 🔧
- Data Modeling 📐
- Calculated Fields 🔢

## Data Sourcing
The data for this analysis was acquired from a comprehensive e-commerce dataset, which includes:
- Sales records
- Customer information
- Product details
- Regional sales data

This dataset provides an extensive view of transaction dynamics and customer behavior.

## Data Transformation
The data was cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy and consistency:
- **Removed duplicates** and handled missing values
- **Standardized** data formats
- **Aggregated** data by product categories and regions

## Modelling
Key models and metrics were developed to analyze performance:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Categorized customers into Low, Medium, and High Value
- **Sales Forecasting**: Used historical data to predict future sales trends

## Analysis & Visualization
Key analyses were performed using Tableau and SQL:
- **Sales Trends Over Time**: Identified peaks and troughs in sales and seasonal patterns
- **Top-Selling Products**: Analyzed product performance by revenue and quantity
- **Segmented Purchase Analysis**: Segmented customers by total purchase value (Low, Medium, High) and included regional performance insights
- **Summary KPI's**: Consolidated key metrics such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and Retention Rate

### Key Findings

| Metric                      | Value                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Top-Selling Product**     | Regency Cakestand (£164,000) |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | £52.30                |
| **Retention Rate**          | 87-92% Monthly        |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | £860.37           |

## Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made:
- **Optimize Inventory Management**: Adjust inventory levels to align with identified seasonal sales trends.
- **Enhance Customer Retention**: Implement targeted campaigns and improve loyalty programs.
- **Increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Focus on cross-selling and upselling strategies.
- **Investigate Sales Fluctuations**: Explore reasons behind significant sales spikes and drops.
